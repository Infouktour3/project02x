Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
[Bootstrap v5.3] (https://getbootstrap.com/)
Bootstrap has been visited to assist me with the idea to create a responsiveness webssite and it help me a bit but I used at the end a word file attached on github. 
[Frameworks] (https://github.com/Infouktour3/project02x)

Hover.css was used for the two  bottoms added on the game page to be visible their function and helping to drive the user on using properly the game.

Font Awesome:
Font Awesome was used on the first and second page page of the site to decorate the Title and make it intuitive for the game ahead,
which the icons help also the aesthetic of the site and UX purposes.

GitHub has been used to store the projects code, after being added and pushed from Gitpod and workspace. Plus to cloen and deploy my project.

Balsamiq was visited to gather some idea on starting the design process even if I used my imagination at the end and created it with a word file and coverted in pjg.

jQuery:
jQuery find some information in bootstrap and in code istitue

on use to have a responsive website for different devices. I have also used different source like youtube and W3school sites to improve the responsiveness of the website.

Testing
I have tested the website on W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator  and JS Validator, the services were used to validate every page of html, css and js.
It help to avoid any syntax errors. A lot of range of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
